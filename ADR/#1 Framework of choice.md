# #1 Framwork of choice

## Status

accepted

## Context

The development time for this application is limited. There needs to be a widget as soon as possible. Most recent experience of the 'team' is in vue. There is no experience with creating widgets in the team.

## Decision

The framework we will use for creating this weather widget will be vue. Vue has support for custom elements and is created to run on a single element.

Other options considered were Angular and React. The not-recent experience level with these frameworks were leading in the decisions to not use them for a non-standard project.

## Consequences

Development of the application should be well within the capabilities of the 'team'
Changing the framework at a later time is difficult and timeconsuming.
